The Upside of a Downturn

It's no secret that the technology industry is currently in a downturn. From soaring valuations to tumbling stock prices, it seems that the market has turned against even the most innovative companies. But don't despair – this is not the end of innovation. In fact, downturns can be the catalyst for positive change, and the best time to prepare for the next upswing.

At Lightspeed, we maintain a positive outlook, believing that progress in technology carries forward throughout all market cycles. As investors, we've seen the market go through corrections before, such as the dot-com bubble burst of 2000-2002 and the financial crisis of 2008-2009. And in each case, we've seen companies emerge stronger, leaner, and more focused on their core businesses.

So, what can CEOs do during these downturns to emerge stronger than ever? We encourage leaders to make hard decisions and critical changes to their businesses during crises. These decisions will position them stronger when markets normalize again.

One of the most critical changes CEOs can make is to revise their assumptions about talent. In a market downturn, many talented professionals are looking for new opportunities, and companies should be poised to take advantage of this. By carefully evaluating their existing workforce, CEOs can identify areas of overlap and eliminate redundancies while creating new positions that reflect their evolving business needs.

Another important change is cutting non-essential activities. During boom times, it's easy to become complacent and let inefficiencies creep into the business. A downturn can be an opportunity to reassess what is truly essential to the business and focus on those areas. This may mean trimming the number of product lines, divesting non-core businesses, or even downsizing the organization.

Honing the business model is another crucial step companies can take during a downturn. During market exuberance, companies may pursue growth at all costs, but in a downturn, the focus should be on building sustainable businesses. This requires a deep understanding of the company's customer base, value proposition, and competitive landscape. By tightening their focus and sharpening their business model, companies can emerge from a downturn with a stronger position in the market.

Some of our portfolio companies have demonstrated these principles in action. For example, one of our companies decided to shift its entire product strategy during the last downturn. By moving from a hardware-centric model to a cloud-based service, the company was able to pivot quickly and take advantage of new market opportunities. Another company focused on refining its sales strategy, identifying its most profitable channels and focusing on them exclusively. This allowed them to emerge from the downturn with a leaner, more efficient sales organization.

In conclusion, downturns can be an opportunity for companies to make critical changes that position them for long-term success. Rather than viewing these market corrections as a negative, CEOs should embrace them as an opportunity to reassess their businesses, make tough decisions, and emerge stronger and more focused on their core business. At Lightspeed, we believe that the current downturn in the technology industry will ultimately be a catalyst for positive change, and we look forward to supporting our portfolio companies as they navigate this challenging market.
