Richard Scudamore says Premier League is 'not a charity' following £5bn TV deal

Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the Premier League, has defended the league's decision to accept a record-breaking £5.136bn ($7.8bn) television deal with Sky and BT Sport. Speaking to reporters after the announcement of the deal, Scudamore said that the Premier League is "not a charity" and that it was important to secure the best possible deal for its clubs.

The new deal represents a 70% increase on the previous agreement and is the richest in football history. Under the terms of the deal, each game will cost £10.2m, up from £6.5m in the last deal. The Premier League has said that it will continue to sell rights to the highest bidder.

Sky has secured five of the seven packages on offer, while BT has taken the remaining two. The deal means that both broadcasters will have the rights to show live Premier League matches from the 2016-17 season until the end of the 2018-19 season.

Scudamore said that the deal was "fantastic news" for the Premier League and its clubs. He added that the league had received "unprecedented interest" from broadcasters and that the final deal had been "competitive and robust."

The Premier League has faced criticism in recent years over the amount of money it generates and the impact that this has on smaller clubs. However, Scudamore defended the league's financial model, arguing that the money generated by the new TV deal would be distributed fairly among all 20 Premier League clubs.

He said: "The Premier League is not a charity. It's a commercial entity, and it's our job to make sure we secure the best possible deal for our clubs. The money generated by this new deal will be distributed fairly among all 20 Premier League clubs, which will help to ensure a level playing field and a competitive league."

Scudamore also said that the Premier League was committed to investing in grassroots football and supporting the development of young players. He added that the league would continue to work with the Football Association and other stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of the new deal were felt across the wider football community.

The announcement of the new TV deal has been welcomed by many fans and pundits, who see it as a sign of the Premier League's continuing dominance in world football. However, others have expressed concern about the impact that the huge sums of money involved could have on the game.

The Premier League's decision to continue to sell TV rights to the highest bidder has also raised questions about the long-term future of free-to-air coverage of football in the UK. However, for now at least, fans can look forward to a new era of Premier League football, with more matches and greater coverage than ever before.
