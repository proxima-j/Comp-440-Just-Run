Bigger Chickens Bring a Tough New Problem: ‘Woody Breast’

In recent years, the global food industry has been faced with a new problem as chickens bred for meat are rapidly growing bigger. Researchers have discovered that the birds are developing a muscle condition known as "woody breast," which affects the quality and taste of the breast meat. This has led to a growing concern in the industry as it affects the texture of the meat, making it "gummy" and harder to chew.

According to industry experts, woody breast is a result of hard fibres that degrade the texture of the meat. While it poses no threat to human health, it has become a major issue affecting the quality of meat. Currently, between 5-10% of boneless breast fillets sold worldwide are affected by woody breast.

Scientists suggest that the breeding of heavier and faster-growing birds over the last few decades may be a major factor contributing to the problem. The rapid growth of the birds has resulted in the production of larger breasts that are unable to sustain the increased muscle mass, leading to the development of woody breast.

This is a significant issue for the global food industry as chicken meat is one of the most popular sources of protein worldwide. The increase in the prevalence of woody breast has led to a decline in the quality of meat, which in turn affects the demand for it. Industry experts have warned that if the problem persists, it could lead to a significant impact on the poultry industry's profits.

The issue of woody breast has prompted researchers to look for solutions to the problem. One possible solution is to alter the breeding process to produce chickens with more sustainable muscle growth. Another possible solution is to use enzymes to break down the hard fibres in the meat, resulting in a better texture.

Despite the challenges posed by woody breast, the global food industry is confident that it will find solutions to the problem. Companies are investing heavily in research to find new ways of producing high-quality chicken meat that meets consumers' expectations. The industry is also collaborating with farmers to implement new breeding practices that promote sustainable muscle growth, thus reducing the risk of woody breast.

In conclusion, the issue of woody breast is a significant challenge facing the global food industry. The condition affects the quality and taste of chicken meat, and if left unaddressed, could have significant implications for the poultry industry's profitability. However, the industry is optimistic that solutions will be found to the problem, and that consumers will continue to enjoy high-quality chicken meat for years to come.
